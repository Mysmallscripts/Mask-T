Extract pose or cut hidden masked areas of a mesh in Blender 2.8 in sculpt mode and apply volume with the solidify modier. 

Works without masking the area too and just hidding it.

Clone download unzip and install it just like a regular addons.

The addons create a tab in the n panel in the 3d view.
